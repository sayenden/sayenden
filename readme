👋 Hi, I'm Sayenden

I design and build systems that reduce cognitive load, surface better decisions, and give individuals and small teams more leverage than they’ve ever had. My work lives at the intersection of automation, money, rewards, and the emerging world of agentic systems.

## 🍀 My Path as a Builder

I’ve been working on zero-to-one ideas for over a decade. My first company, RealtyForSale, started as a simple question: *why is property search so fractured, slow, and opaque?* My co-founder and I built an ML-powered marketplace that grew faster than we expected. It gained national press in Yahoo! Finance, the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, Vancouver Sun and earned me a BC Business 30 Under 30 award. Eventually, I sold my position and moved on — but the experience shaped everything that came after.

That journey taught me the rhythm of product:  
find real tension → design the right system → ship early → learn aggressively → simplify.

Today, during the week, I am a Senior Product Manager at Amazon. I work on large-scale systems and AI-driven decision tooling across distributed teams. It’s a space that keeps me sharp, grounded, and continuously exposed to the realities of systems at scale.

Outside of that, I return to the part of building that feels the most alive: exploring new ideas that don’t have a clear map yet.

## 🚀 The Idea I'm Exploring: Agentic Workforces

I believe we’re moving from a world where software behaves like a **toolbox** to a world where software behaves like a **team**.

Not general AI.  
Not generic assistants.  
But scoped, accountable agents that hold real responsibilities.

Agents that:
- watch over parts of the business,
- reason about incoming signals,
- take action when appropriate,
- and report back in understandable ways.

In this worldview, small teams — even solo builders — can operate at a level that previously required multiple specialized roles. This concept of **agentic workforces** is the spine of all my work today.

## 🧱 What I'm Building

### Agentsie  
Agentsie is my exploration of how small businesses can scale by giving “jobs” to agents, not by adding headcount.

Instead of needing full teams for SEO, research, content scanning, competitor tracking, insights, or rewards intelligence, a business should be able to spin up agents that own these scopes with clarity and reliability. Not prompts — responsibilities. Not magic — predictable systems.

Agentsie is where I build those patterns. Walletsie is where they get tested.

### Walletsie  
Walletsie is the consumer product where I explore another problem I care deeply about: how people make decisions about money and rewards.

Money decisions are high-stakes but often chaotic — fragmented tools, hidden opportunities, cognitive load, constant monitoring. Walletsie blends financial guidance, rewards intelligence, automation, and agentic workflows to reduce that burden and surface patterns people would otherwise miss.

And importantly, Walletsie is a live environment. Agents introduced here must operate under real constraints, real users, and real consequences. It’s where theory becomes practical.

## 🎛 How I Think About Product

I’m drawn to problems where behavior, incentives, information, and ambiguity collide. I care about systems that make people feel more capable, not more overwhelmed. I like interfaces that respect attention and context. I care about flows that compress complexity into clarity.

My work follows a familiar arc:
start from first principles → build the simplest viable version → learn from real use → refine the system, not just the UI → scale only what works.

Zero-to-one isn’t a phase. It’s a way of working.

## 🤖 Why Agents Matter

Agents offer something we’ve never had before: continuous, contextual leverage.

They can watch for patterns humans overlook, explore spaces we don’t have time for, and automate reasoning that would otherwise consume hours. When designed with the right boundaries, they become collaborators — not tools.

Agentsie is where I explore the architecture, boundaries, and behaviors that make agents trustworthy. Walletsie is where these ideas must hold up under real conditions.

## 📌 About Me

I’m currently a Senior Product Manager at Amazon, focused on systems, AI-driven decision tooling, and cross-functional execution at scale.

Before that, I co-founded and exited RealtyForSale. My work has been featured in Yahoo! Finance, the Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, Vancouver Sun, and I was recognized with BC Business 30 Under 30.

Across everything I do, I’m interested in:  
agentic systems, automation, fintech, decision architecture, rewards optimization, and reducing the cognitive overhead of everyday life.

If you’re exploring agentic operations, small-business leverage, or new ways people can interface with intelligence systems, I’m always open to connect.
