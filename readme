# Hi, I'm Sayenden 👋

I build products, design systems, and solve messy problems.  
Weekdays, I work in big tech leading product areas that need structure, clarity, and tight execution.  
Nights and weekends, I build and invest in things I wish existed.

I like working where behavior, money, and automation meet.

🔧 What I’m Building

💳 Walletsie
A smarter layer on top of your money. It routes funds, applies rules, and automates the boring parts of personal finance.

🌲 Spruce Hill
A small, selective early-stage fund backing builders who move quickly and think independently.

🧠 What I Work On

- Product systems from scratch: turning ambiguous spaces into real products  
- Automation + AI workflows that remove friction from everyday work  
- Data-shaped decision-making: experiments, insights, and focused loops  
- Cross-functional execution across engineering, design, analytics, ops  
- Tools, scripts, and smaller builds that solve actual problems in my day-to-day life  

I’ve worked across both large-scale systems and consumer surfaces.  
My approach stays constant: clarity, speed, and strong product taste.
