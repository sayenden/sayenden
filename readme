# 👋 Hi, I'm Sayenden

I design and build systems that reduce cognitive load, improve decision-making, and give individuals and small teams more leverage.  
My work lives where automation, money, rewards, and agentic systems overlap.

## 🧩 My Path as a Builder

I’ve been building zero-to-one products for over a decade.

My first company, **RealtyForSale**, was an ML-powered real estate marketplace that:
- scaled to meaningful traction,  
- was covered in **Yahoo! Finance**, **Globe & Mail**, **Toronto Star**, **Vancouver Sun**,  
- earned a **BC Business 30 Under 30** award,  
- and eventually led to me selling my position.

That experience anchored how I think about product:
> find real tension → design the right system → ship early → learn hard → simplify.

Today:
- I’m a **Senior Product Manager at Amazon**, working on large-scale systems and AI-driven decision tooling.  
- Outside of work, I’m focused on **Agentsie** and **Walletsie** — my long-term explorations into agentic product systems.

## 🚀 The Idea: Agentic Workforces

Software is shifting from tools you operate to teammates you assign work to.

I call this shift **agentic workforces**:
- not generic assistants,  
- not one-off scripts,  
- but scoped, reliable agents that own real responsibilities.

These agents:
- observe  
- reason  
- take action  
- report back  
- and stay inside clear boundaries

My work is about making that concept real inside actual products, not just demos.

## 🧱 What I'm Building

### 🧠 Agentsie — Agentic leverage for small businesses

**Agentsie** explores how small businesses can scale by adding agents instead of headcount.

Examples of agent “roles” I care about:
- SEO and organic discovery  
- content and research scanning  
- competitor and market tracking  
- customer and retention insights  
- rewards and points intelligence  

Each agent is modeled more like a teammate than a tool:
- defined scope  
- owned responsibilities  
- specific tools and data  
- handoff rules  
- reporting and review

I use **Walletsie** as the proving ground for these agents.

### 💳 Walletsie — Money, rewards, and everyday decisions

**Walletsie** is a product in a space I care deeply about:  
how people make everyday decisions about money and rewards.

It’s part financial guide, part rewards engine, part automation layer.

Walletsie aims to:
- reduce the mental overhead of managing money,  
- surface opportunities you’d usually miss,  
- make tradeoffs and value clearer,  
- and quietly automate repetitive reasoning.

It’s also the live environment where agentic workflows from Agentsie are tested under real constraints.

## 🎛 How I Think About Product

I’m drawn to problems that are:
- behavior-heavy  
- ambiguous  
- cognitively demanding  
- full of repeated decisions  
- important, but hard to structure  

When I design and build, I try to:
- start from first principles  
- strip away noise and ceremony  
- ship something real quickly  
- tune based on actual usage  
- build systems that scale quietly in the background  

For me, zero-to-one isn’t a phase — it’s a way of working.

## 🤖 Why Agents Matter

Agents give individuals and small teams a kind of operational leverage that used to require headcount.

Done right, agents can:
- monitor signals and conditions,  
- surface insights and patterns,  
- automate well-understood workflows,  
- support consistent decision-making,  
- and extend what a single builder can realistically handle.

**Agentsie** is where I develop these patterns.  
**Walletsie** is where they have to prove themselves.

## 🎨 Product, Systems, and Taste

I care about:
- systems that make people feel more capable, not more overwhelmed  
- interfaces that respect attention and context  
- flows that compress complexity into clear, actionable choices  
- products that have a point of view  

A lot of my work is deciding what *not* to let agents do — scope and boundaries are design decisions.
