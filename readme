Hi, I'm **Sayenden** 👋

Builder · Agentic Systems · Automation · Money, Rewards & Decision-Making

I’m exploring how far a single builder can go with a network of agents doing real work.

## 🌱 Where This Started

I’ve been building products for a while.  
My first real attempt was **RealtyForSale**, a zero→one real estate marketplace that taught me what building actually feels like — uncertainty, iteration, and the occasional “this might actually work” moment.

Weekdays, I work in big tech. I help shape systems at scale, learn from people sharper than me, and try to stay pretty humble about it.

Nights and weekends are where I chase the ideas that don’t let go.

## 🧵 The Opportunity I’m Going After

I keep coming back to the same cluster of problems:

- Money and financial decisions  
- Rewards, points, and value extraction  
- Search, discovery, and content  
- Automation and workflows  
- Agents that can own real chunks of work  

I don’t think the next wave of products in this space will be just “another app” or dashboard.  
I think they’ll be **collections of focused agents** that understand context, do work, and help people decide with less friction.

**Walletsie** is my focused way into that opportunity.  
**Agentsie** is the enabling layer that makes it scalable.

## 🔧 What I’m Building

### 🧠 Agentsie — Agentic Workforce for Small Businesses

**Agentsie** is my attempt to help small businesses “hire” agents like they’d hire employees.

Instead of needing a full team for things like:
- SEO and organic discovery  
- content and research  
- competitor and market monitoring  
- analytics and retention insights  

…you should be able to spin up scoped agents that:
- own a narrow slice of work  
- plug into your existing stack  
- collaborate with other agents  
- and report back with clear, explainable output

I’m using **Walletsie** as the proving ground. If agents can reliably support different parts of Walletsie, they can support other small businesses too.

### 💳 Walletsie — Money, Rewards, and Everyday Financial Choices

**Walletsie** is the business I’m building in the middle of this opportunity space.

It sits somewhere between:
- a money copilot  
- a rewards optimizer  
- a trusted guide for “what’s the smart move here?”  

The long-term arc I’m exploring is:

- How much of the repetitive, analytical work around money and rewards can be handled by agents?  
- How can automation and agents reduce the cognitive load of everyday decisions without taking control away from the user?

Walletsie is both a real product and a testbed for agentic operations.

### 🌲 Spruce Hill — Supporting Other Builders

**Spruce Hill** is a small, selective fund I run to support early builders.

It keeps me close to:
- how other people are attacking hard problems  
- what kinds of tools and systems they wish existed  
- where agents and automation might actually help, not just sound good in a deck

## 🧠 How I Work

I gravitate toward problems that are:

- behavior-driven  
- messy and nonlinear  
- full of repeated decisions  
- high in cognitive overhead  

I like:
- starting from scratch  
- shipping small, fast experiments  
- tightening feedback loops with real users  
- tools that simplify, not impress  
- systems that scale quietly in the background  

I’ve worked across both large-scale internal systems and smaller consumer-facing products, but the pattern I care about most is simple:  
**take something from nothing → something real.**

## 🚀 Why I’m Building This

I think software is shifting from being a **collection of tools** to being more like a **team you collaborate with**.

In that world:
- individuals and small teams can punch way above their weight  
- agents can own ongoing responsibilities, not just one-off tasks  
- and the boundary between “builder” and “organization” looks different

I’m building **Agentsie** to explore that shift directly.  
I’m building **Walletsie** because money, rewards, and everyday decisions are where this feels especially valuable and human.

The goal isn’t to posture about scale.  
It’s to see how far a focused builder can go with the right agentic layer — and to build useful, grounded products along the way.

## 📌 About Me

- Builder at heart, PM by trade  
- Started with **RealtyForSale** (0→1 ML-powered marketplace)  
- Work in big tech; build **Walletsie** and **Agentsie** outside of it  
- Interested in agents, automation, fintech, rewards, and decision systems  
- Learn by shipping, not by theorizing

If you’re working on agents-as-teammates, small-business automation, or new ways for solo builders to scale, I’m always open to compare notes.
