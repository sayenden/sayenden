# Hi, I'm Sayenden 👋

I build systems, ship products, and tackle ambiguous problems.  
By day, I work in big tech leading product areas that require tight execution, deep systems thinking, and cross-functional alignment.

Outside of work, I build and invest in products I genuinely care about — especially around fintech, automation, and tools that remove friction from real life.

Right now, that looks like:

- 💳 **[Walletsie](https://walletsie.com/)** — a smarter layer on top of your money that handles routing, rules, and automations without budgeting headaches.
- 🌲 **[Spruce Hill](https://sprucehill.co/)** — a selective early-stage fund backing high-leverage builders before they become obvious.

## What I Work On

- 🧱 **Zero→one product development** — turning vague spaces into crisp problems and real products.
- 🤖 **Automation + AI-driven workflows** — systems that reduce manual load and amplify velocity.
- 📊 **Data-backed product loops** — metrics, experimentation, behavioral insights, and growth systems.
- 🧩 **Cross-functional leadership** — engineering, design, analytics, ops, and strategy under one umbrella.
- 🔧 **Side projects that ship fast** — small tools, experiments, and utilities that evolve with users.

I’ve worked across both enterprise-scale systems and consumer-facing surfaces.  
Regardless of domain, my approach stays the same: **clarity, speed, and strong product taste.**

## About Me

- I work in **big tech** on complex product surfaces with high stakes and wide blast radius.  
- I specialize in creating structured systems, scaling processes, and driving execution across teams.  
- Nights/weekends, I build my own products and run a micro-VC fund (Spruce Hill) to support early builders.  
- I like products with sharp opinions, tight feedback loops, and long-term compounding potential.

## Current Focus

- Iterating on **Walletsie** with a tighter product loop and sharper automation.  
- Building **Spruce Hill’s operational OS** — tooling, evaluation frameworks, and portfolio workflows.  
- Publishing open-source utilities based on automation and AI-assisted workflows from my day-to-day life.
