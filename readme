# Hi, I'm Sayenden 👋

I build systems, ship products, and work on problems that don’t have clean edges.  
My day job is in big tech, where I lead product work across areas that require clear thinking, solid execution, and coordination across engineering, design, analytics, and operations.

Outside of work, I build and invest in projects that I personally find useful or interesting. Two that I’m focused on right now:

**Walletsie**  
A smarter layer on top of your money. It handles routing, rules, automation, and all the unglamorous work most people don’t have time for.

**Spruce Hill**  
A small early-stage fund I run to back builders who move quickly and think for themselves.

## What I work on

I gravitate toward products that sit at the intersection of behavior, automation, and financial decision-making. My background includes zero-to-one work, scaling systems inside large organizations, and creating the operational and analytical frameworks that keep teams aligned.

Outside of my main role, I build smaller tools, workflows, and experiments—usually around automation, AI-assisted decisioning, or simplifying something unnecessarily painful.

## How I think

Move quickly, but with taste.  
Keep products focused and opinionated.  
Build for compounding, not chaos.  
Make decisions with data, but don’t wait for perfect data.  
And whenever possible, automate the boring parts.

## Current focus

Walletsie is evolving quickly as I tighten the loops around routing rules, user workflows, and financial automation.  
Spruce Hill is developing its internal operating system—evaluation frameworks, portfolio tools, and lightweight systems for early-stage investing.  
On the side, I open-source small utilities and workflows that come out of my day-to-day work.
