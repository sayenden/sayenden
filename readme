# Hi, I'm Sayenden

I build systems that reduce cognitive load, streamline decisions, and give small teams and individual builders more leverage.  
My work sits at the intersection of automation, money, rewards, and agents.

I’ve been building zero-to-one products for more than a decade. My first company, RealtyForSale, grew quickly, was covered in major press (Yahoo! Finance, Globe & Mail, Toronto Star, Vancouver Sun), won a BC Business 30 Under 30 award, and I eventually sold my position. That experience anchored how I think about product: find a real problem, work backward, ship, learn, iterate.

During the week, I work in big tech shipping large-scale systems. Nights and weekends are where I pursue the ideas I’m convinced should exist.

## What I’m Building

### Agentsie  
Agentsie is my exploration into the idea that small businesses should operate with agentic leverage.  
If you run a business, you usually need people to handle SEO, analytics, research, partnerships, insights, content shaping, market scanning, and more. Most small teams can’t hire for all of that.

Agentsie tries to answer a simple question:  
**What if you could spin up scoped agents as if they were team members?**

An SEO agent.  
A research agent.  
A retention agent.  
A points-and-perks intelligence agent.  
A competitor-tracking agent.

Defined scopes. Predictable behavior. Real contribution.

I’m proving it first inside Walletsie. If agents can materially support Walletsie, they can support many other small businesses too.

### Walletsie  
Walletsie is the real business where I apply agentic systems to a problem I care deeply about: money and everyday financial decisions.

It’s part financial guide, part rewards brain, part automation layer.  
The goal is to help people reduce the mental overhead of managing money, make better decisions, and surface opportunities they’d miss on their own.

Walletsie is also my testbed:  
How far can agentic systems go in supporting a live product with real users and evolving needs?

## How I Think About Product

My work tends to revolve around problems that feel messy:
- high cognitive load  
- repeated decisions  
- behavior-driven patterns  
- ambiguous workflows  
- information that’s hard to organize but important to understand  

I like:
- starting from scratch  
- stripping away everything unnecessary  
- shipping fast and fixing what matters  
- building systems that scale quietly  
- tools that make people feel more capable, not more overwhelmed  

Zero-to-one isn’t a phase — it’s a mindset:  
take something unclear, understand the core tension, and turn it into something real.

## My View on Agents

Software is shifting from a world of “tools you operate” to “teammates you assign work to.”  
Not general AI, not magic — just scoped, reliable agents that handle meaningful responsibilities.

Agents at their best should:
- observe  
- reason  
- take action  
- report back  
- and stay within well-defined boundaries  

Agentsie is my way of building a practical version of this future.  
Walletsie is where the theory meets reality.

I care less about hype and more about whether agents can:
- uncover opportunities  
- reduce friction  
- provide leverage to small teams  
- and make decisions easier and clearer  

That’s the through-line of my work.
